"""
List of OpenAI function-calling definitions used by the Canva assistant.

Currently includes:
- canva_doc_search: A semantic search function for answering questions related to using Canva.

Function Purpose:
- Enables the assistant to respond to Canva-related queries by retrieving relevant content
  from parsed instructional Markdown documents stored in a Supabase vector store.

Structure:
- name (str): The function identifier used by the assistant.
- description (str): When and why the assistant should call this function.
- parameters (dict):
    - type (str): Must be "object".
    - properties (dict): Defines accepted fields (currently only "query").
    - required (list): Specifies mandatory fields (["query"]).

Usage:
- This function is triggered by OpenAI's function-calling interface when the user asks
  a Canva usage question (e.g., editing a template, using tools, exporting designs).
- The result is handled by `function_calling_handler` and used to construct a grounded, step-by-step response.

Note:
- Each returned document chunk includes `content`, `metadata` (with source page), and a similarity score.
- The assistant should cite the source pages at the end of the response for traceability.
