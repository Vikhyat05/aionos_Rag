# What is Canva?

**Canva** is an easy-to-use graphic design platform that allows you to create Carleton-branded visual content, including social media graphics, posters, flyers, and more. It’s available to use in your browser. After creating your piece, it can be downloaded as an image file or PDF and immediately shared or is ready to print.
